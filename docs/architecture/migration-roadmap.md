# Migration Roadmap: Resimate Cloud Migration

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: September 1, 2025  
**Last Updated**: September 1, 2025  
**Owner**: Shamail Saidi  
**Status**: Phase 1 - Planning Complete

## Executive Summary

This migration roadmap provides a detailed, phase-by-phase approach to migrating Resimate from its current Firebase/GCP architecture to a cloud-agnostic, Kubernetes-based solution. The migration follows a 24-week timeline across 4 major phases, with 5 planned customer deployments over 12-24 months.

**Key Objectives**:
- Zero-downtime migration from Firebase/GCP to cloud-agnostic architecture
- Enable customer deployments across AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premise environments
- Maintain compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2 requirements
- Achieve performance parity with current system

## Migration Strategy Overview

### Migration Approach: Parallel Development + Blue/Green Deployment

1. **Parallel Development**: Build new architecture alongside existing system
2. **Incremental Migration**: Migrate services in phases to minimize risk
3. **Data Synchronization**: Maintain data consistency during transition
4. **Blue/Green Deployment**: Switch traffic after validation
5. **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to revert at each phase

### Critical Success Factors

| Factor | Requirement | Measurement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Zero Downtime** | No service interruption > 5 minutes | SLA monitoring |
| **Data Integrity** | 100% data consistency during migration | Data validation scripts |
| **Performance Parity** | Response times within 20% of current | Load testing benchmarks |
| **Security Compliance** | Pass all compliance audits | Third-party validation |
| **User Experience** | No authentication or functionality loss | User acceptance testing |
