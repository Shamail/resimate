# Project Charter: Resimate Cloud Migration

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 1, 2025  
**Project Manager**: Shamail (Consulting)  
**Client**: Resimate.io (Patrick & Floyd)  

## Executive Summary

Resimate.io is migrating from a single-tenant SaaS architecture on GCP/Firebase to a cloud-agnostic containerized solution deployable in customer environments across AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premise infrastructure.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objective
Enable Resimate to deploy their resilience management platform directly in customer cloud environments while maintaining security, scalability, and operational efficiency.

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Cloud Independence**: Remove dependencies on GCP-specific services
2. **Standardization**: Create repeatable deployment processes
3. **Compliance Ready**: Support GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2 requirements
4. **Operational Excellence**: Maintain or improve current reliability and performance
5. **Cost Optimization**: Enable efficient resource utilization across platforms

## Business Drivers

### Customer Requirements
- **Data Sovereignty**: Customers want data in their own cloud environments
- **Compliance**: Industry-specific regulatory requirements
- **Integration**: Easier integration with customer's existing infrastructure
- **Control**: Customer control over updates and maintenance schedules

### Business Benefits
- **Market Expansion**: Access to enterprise customers with cloud deployment requirements
- **Competitive Advantage**: Differentiation from SaaS-only competitors  
- **Revenue Growth**: Premium pricing for customer-deployed instances
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduced dependency on single cloud provider

## Project Scope

### In Scope
✅ **Architecture Design**: Cloud-agnostic system architecture  
✅ **Technology Migration**: Replace Firebase services with open-source alternatives  
✅ **Infrastructure as Code**: Pulumi templates for multi-cloud deployment  
✅ **Containerization**: Docker images for all services  
✅ **Migration Tools**: Automated migration from current Firebase setup  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive deployment and operational guides  
✅ **Proof of Concept**: Working deployment on at least 2 cloud platforms  
✅ **Security Framework**: Compliance-ready security controls  

### Out of Scope
❌ **Production Migrations**: Actual customer environment deployments  
❌ **24/7 Support**: Ongoing operational support for customer environments  
❌ **Custom Features**: New feature development beyond migration needs  
❌ **Training**: End-user training on the Resimate platform  
❌ **Hardware Procurement**: Physical infrastructure for on-premise deployments  

### Assumptions
- Current Resimate codebase is containerization-ready
- Customer environments meet minimum Kubernetes requirements
- Firebase Auth user data is exportable
- Current API contracts remain unchanged
- PostgreSQL can be used across all target platforms

## Stakeholders

| Role | Name | Responsibilities |
|------|------|-----------------|
| **Project Sponsor** | Patrick (Resimate CEO) | Project approval, strategic decisions |
| **Technical Lead** | Floyd (Resimate CTO) | Architecture review, technical decisions |
| **Consultant** | Shamail | Project execution, deliverables |

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
1. **Multi-Cloud Deployment**: Successful deployment on AWS, Azure, GCP
2. **Feature Parity**: All current functionality available in containerized version
3. **Performance**: Response times within 20% of current Firebase implementation
4. **Security**: Pass security audit for GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 requirements
5. **Scalability**: Support for expected customer load patterns

### Business Success
1. **Customer Validation**: At least 2 pilot customers successfully deployed
2. **Deployment Time**: Customer environment setup in under 4 hours
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Infrastructure costs within customer budget expectations
4. **Maintenance**: Updates deployable across environments in under 2 hours

### Documentation Success
1. **Deployment Guides**: Non-technical staff can follow deployment procedures
2. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues documented with solutions
3. **Architecture**: Technical architecture clearly documented for future development

## Target Deployments

| Timeline | Platform | Customer Type | Status |
|----------|----------|---------------|--------|
| Q4 2025 | GCP GKE | Pilot Customer | Planned |
| Q1 2026 | AWS EKS | Enterprise Customer | Planned |
| Q2 2026 | Azure AKS | TBD | Planned |
| Q2 2026 | Azure AKS | TBD | Planned |
| Q3 2026 | On-Premise | TBD | Planned |

## Budget & Timeline

**Total Duration**: 24 weeks (6 months)  
**Start Date**: September 2025  
**Target Completion**: March 2025  

### Resource Allocation
- **Architecture & Documentation**: 40% effort
- **Infrastructure Development**: 35% effort  
- **Migration Tools**: 15% effort
- **Testing & Validation**: 10% effort

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Authentication Migration Complexity**: Firebase Auth to Ory Kratos data migration
2. **Performance Degradation**: Kubernetes overhead vs Firebase Functions
3. **Multi-Cloud Complexity**: Different cloud service capabilities and limitations
4. **Customer Environment Variables**: Unpredictable customer infrastructure constraints

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Early Prototyping**: Build authentication migration proof-of-concept early
2. **Performance Testing**: Continuous benchmarking throughout development  
3. **Provider Abstraction**: Use Kubernetes and standard tools to minimize cloud differences
4. **Flexible Architecture**: Design for configurability and adaptation

## Communication Plan
