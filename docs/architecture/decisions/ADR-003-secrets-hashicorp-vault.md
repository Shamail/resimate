**Deciders**: Shamail Saidi, Floyd (CTO)  

## Context

We need an enterprise-grade secrets management solution that works across multiple cloud providers and on-premise deployments while meeting compliance requirements.

## Decision

We will use HashiCorp Vault for centralized secrets management, encryption as a service, and dynamic secrets generation.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Cloud-agnostic with consistent interface
- Dynamic secrets reduce security risk
- Encryption as a service for application-level encryption
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Industry standard for enterprise secrets management

### Negative
- Operational complexity
- Requires careful backup and disaster recovery planning
- Learning curve for development teams

## Alternatives Considered

1. **AWS Secrets Manager**: AWS-specific
2. **Azure Key Vault**: Azure-specific
3. **Google Secret Manager**: GCP-specific
4. **Kubernetes Secrets**: Not suitable for multi-cloud, limited features
5. **Sealed Secrets**: Good for GitOps but limited functionality
