## Zero-Trust Security Model

### Core Principles

1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**
   - All access requests authenticated and authorized
   - No implicit trust based on network location
   - Continuous verification of identity and device

2. **Least Privilege Access**
   - Minimal permissions for all identities
   - Just-in-time access provisioning
   - Regular access reviews and revocation

3. **Assume Breach**
   - Design for compromised components
   - Limit blast radius of breaches
   - Rapid detection and response

### Implementation Components

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Identity Verification** | Ory Kratos + MFA | Strong authentication |
| **Device Trust** | Device certificates | Device attestation |
| **Network Segmentation** | Kubernetes NetworkPolicies | Micro-segmentation |
| **Encryption Everywhere** | mTLS, TLS 1.3 | Data protection |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | SIEM, IDS | Threat detection |

## Authentication and Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

```yaml
# MFA Configuration
mfa_policy:
  required_for:
    - admin_users: always
    - regular_users: risk_based
    - service_accounts: certificate_based
  
  methods:
    primary:
      - totp: Google Authenticator, Authy
      - webauthn: YubiKey, Touch ID, Windows Hello
    backup:
      - sms: Rate limited
      - recovery_codes: One-time use
  
  risk_factors:
    - new_device: require_mfa
    - unusual_location: require_mfa
    - sensitive_operation: require_mfa
    - failed_attempts > 3: require_mfa
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

```yaml
# RBAC Matrix
roles:
  super_admin:
    permissions: ["*:*:*"]
    mfa: required_always
    session_timeout: 30m
  
  tenant_admin:
    permissions: 
      - "tenant:*:manage"
      - "users:tenant:*"
      - "data:tenant:*"
    mfa: required_always
    session_timeout: 2h
  
  analyst:
    permissions:
      - "models:tenant:read"
      - "models:tenant:write"
      - "reports:tenant:*"
    mfa: risk_based
    session_timeout: 8h
  
  viewer:
    permissions:
      - "*:tenant:read"
    mfa: optional
    session_timeout: 24h
```

## Network Security

### Network Segmentation

```yaml
# Kubernetes Network Policies
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: database-isolation
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: database
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          tier: backend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          tier: backup
```

### Service Mesh Security (Istio)

```yaml
# mTLS Configuration
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: resimate
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT  # Enforce mTLS for all communications

---
# Authorization Policy
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: api-access
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: core-api
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        principals: ["cluster.local/ns/resimate/sa/frontend"]
    to:
    - operation:
        methods: ["GET", "POST"]
        paths: ["/api/*"]
```

## Data Protection

### Encryption Strategy

| Data State | Method | Key Management | Rotation |
|------------|--------|----------------|----------|
| **At Rest** | AES-256-GCM | HashiCorp Vault | 90 days |
| **In Transit** | TLS 1.3 | Cert-Manager | 30 days |
| **In Use** | Application-level | Vault Transit Engine | On-demand |
| **Backups** | AES-256-GCM | Separate KEK | 180 days |

### Key Management Architecture

```yaml
# HashiCorp Vault Configuration
vault_config:
  seal:
    type: awskms  # Or azurekeyvault, gcpckms
    key_id: "arn:aws:kms:..."
  
  storage:
    type: postgresql
    encryption: true
  
  audit:
    - type: file
      path: /vault/audit/audit.log
    - type: syslog
      facility: AUTH
      tag: vault
  
  policies:
    - database-encryption:
        path: secret/database/*
        capabilities: ["create", "read", "update"]
    
    - application-secrets:
        path: secret/application/*
        capabilities: ["read"]
    
    - transit-encryption:
        path: transit/*
        capabilities: ["encrypt", "decrypt"]
```

### Data Classification and Handling

| Classification | Description | Encryption | Access Control | Retention |
|----------------|-------------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Restricted** | PII, PHI, Financial | Required | Need-to-know | 7 years |
| **Confidential** | Business sensitive | Required | Role-based | 3 years |
| **Internal** | Internal operations | Recommended | Authenticated | 1 year |
| **Public** | Marketing, docs | Optional | Public | Indefinite |
